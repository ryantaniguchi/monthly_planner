# Overview

This program is designed to to act as a simple planner for a small number of users. It is divided into monthly databases, each represented by a text file. Users can look up, add, and delete events from the planner through a user interface.

In creating this software, I sought to improve my understanding of C++. In particular, I sought to improve my understanding of libraries, classes, and the use of header and source files.
